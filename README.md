# Fifty Shades Generator
The Fifty Shades Generator is a breakthrough in erotic fiction. At the click of a button, it generates world-class literature based on a pre-defined vocabulary.

To be honest, if you're here, you're probably looking for the vocabulary. It's here `/src/js/vocabulary.js`

## Requirements
* Bower
* Grunt
* SASS

## Installation
1. `npm install`
2. `bower install`
3. `grunt`

If nothing goes wrong, a heavily optimised index.html will be in the `build` folder, with some other bits. This is what you see on [fiftyshadesgenerator.com](http://www.fiftyshadesgenerator.com). If you wish to develop, a `grunt watch` command is also available.
